# ww.net
Stuff that runs on wolfgang-werner.net.
Probably very boring for you.

This is just to play around with the following setup/process:
* Spring Boot App (w/ MVC and handlebars templating)
* Wrapped into a Docker Container
* Built using Travis CI
* Run on AWS EC2
* DNS via AWS Route 53
* nginx as reverse proxy
* SSL using letsencrypt certificates

Currently it just says Hello World.
